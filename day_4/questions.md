## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
If we have a piece of code we need to use over and over but don't want to have to edit it independently. We can use or define a method.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
 p "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
 puts " #{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

as an example

hello_someone("Alek")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I think i am just having trouble processing all of this at once, its kind of a lot to take in. I am sure itll just take some time.
